# CovidShopper in React Native

This is my implementation of a React Native implementation of the covideshopper mobile App 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have:

```
 Node into your machine, as well an IDE for example Visual Studio Code
```

### Installing

To install just simple run npm install on the root folder of the app


## Running the app Locally

To run the app locally simply run npm start or sudo npm start - the application runs expo which helps load the app on your phone. 

### Expo

When you run the npm start it will open a window on your browser (http://localhost:19002/) with instructions on how to run the app. 

- Install on your phone the expo mobile app
- Scan the QR code with your camera and open the project with your expo app
- It will then load the app and play with it.

## Using the app

Click on Alert the community - Add an Item and then add a storename, location , and quue size 

Press Add Store

And then you can search the store in the Find - missing Items tab. 


## Versioning

This is a first version, the app will keep progressing as I learn more and more.
